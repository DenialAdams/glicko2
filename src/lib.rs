#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! An implementation of the [glicko2 rating system](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf). It's a rating system appropriate for rating a team or player and is leveraged by many chess leagues.
//!
//! To use, create a series of [`GameResult`](struct.GameResult.html) for each team or player in a rating period.
//! Then, for each team or player pass their [`Glicko2Rating`](struct.Glicko2Rating) and list of `GameResult`s
//! to [`new_rating`](fn.new_rating.html) to calculate the new rating for that team or player, which can be saved in place of the old one.
//! This process is then repeated each rating period.

/// Unlike `GameResult`s, which can be constructed with a `Glicko2Rating` or a`GlickoRating`,
/// `new_rating` requires a `Glicko2Rating`. This is because the volatility field present only in
/// `Glicko2Rating` affects the result of the calculation. Using a default volatility can be done,

/// Similarly, converting the final result back to a `GlickoRating` and thus losing data is left to
/// the caller. Generally, converting back to a `GlickoRating` is only needed for display purposes.

/// `sys_constant` is best explained in the words of Mark Glickman himself:
/// > The system constant, τ, which constrains the change in volatility over time, needs to be
/// > set prior to application of the system. Reasonable choices are between 0.3 and 1.2,
/// > though the system should be tested to decide which value results in greatest predictive
/// > accuracy. Smaller values of τ prevent the volatility measures from changing by large
/// > amounts, which in turn prevent enormous changes in ratings based on very improbable
/// > results.
